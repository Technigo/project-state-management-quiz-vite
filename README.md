# State Management Quiz

The project for this week involves creating a dynamic quiz game utilizing Zustand for state management in a React application. This interactive game offers users a series of multiple-choice questions, where they can select their answers. React Router Dom has also been utilized for moving the user between different pages, like the startpage, errorpage, questionpage and summarypage. Accessibility has been in the back of our minds during the entire project. 

A group project by Laura Lyckholm, Anna Robertsson, Julia Holm and Susanne Ekenheim.


### The Problem

The project was done in a group of four people. We mainly worked using mob- and pair programming, using Live Share. We found this to be the best approach to allow for a deeper understanding of the codebase in the whole group. Communication was key. During programming sessions we always notified the others of what we where doing, so that everyone felt involved. If something went wrong, we where all hands on deck trying to figure out the issue by discussing possible problems and outcomes, and by searching the web for solutions. Understanding Zustand was our greatest hurdle, but by discussing with each other, asking help from other teammates and by writing clear comments, we could start to understand the concept better.
