# State Management Quiz

Group project Technigo boot camp week 10 by: Inna Kokic, Jenny Larsen, Vera Witting, Emmy Dieden and Idah Collin. Multiple-choice quiz using Zustand for state management.

### The Problem

Course material, discussing within the group/team and chatGPT was used to build the project. Good communication in the beginning with going through schedules and how to build the project helped. It was a bit tricky to divide the project and at the same time learn as much as possible. Figma was used for planning and design, this helped a lot as well as clear comments and time to hand over the project to make sure everyone was onboard.
