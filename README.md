### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

The task was to create a quiz using Global State. We should then decide if we wanted to use Zustand or useContext.

We started off by discussing the topic of the quiz, and came to the conclusion that we all liked Harry Potter. We then started making a sketch on paper on how it would look, what components we needed and a rough sketch of the styling.

Since we had to choose either Zustand or useContext, we also discussed the pro's and con's of the two of them, and decided to go with Zustand.

We then made a figma file where we divided the tasks among us.
We used ChatGPT to create the questions for the quiz, and tried to make a background using Midjourney. The background didn't turn out the way we wanted, so we decided to go with another image.

As for keeping track on everyones progress on the project, and to make sure no one got stuck on their tasks, we had several short meetings during the week and kept in touch in Slack.

If we had more time, we would like to make a customized hero image for the welcome page. And also a way for the quizzer to be able to choose the difficulty of the questions.
