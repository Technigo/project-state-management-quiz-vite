# State Management Quiz

In our endeavor to grasp state management through global state, we employed Zustand to craft an interactive quiz. This quiz not only engages users with multiple-choice questions but also provides immediate feedback on their responses. Upon completion, users are presented with a summary of their performance, including the tally of correct answers alongside the correct solutions for each question.

## Problem Solving Journey

Our journey commenced with displaying individual questions and their respective answer choices. The challenge then morphed into devising a mechanism to store the selections made by the user. Ultimately, we mastered how to collate and exhibit the results in a summary format. Our planning phase was heavily skewed towards design. Given more time, delving deeper into Zustand and exploring additional facets such as stretch goals would be our next endeavor.
