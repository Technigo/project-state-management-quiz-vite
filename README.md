# State Management Quiz

Create a quiz using Zustand to handle state, plus some css (mine was very basic)

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

This is not my strongest work but I worked hard regardless. I missed having a team as there were so many parts, but once I started breaking it down into smaller "team-pieces" it was easier. I had no inspiratoin for the css as I wanted to keep it simple, the background pic is the best thing of the whole page!

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
