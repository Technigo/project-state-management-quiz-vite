# State Management Quiz

In our project, we employed React in conjunction with Zustand for global state management. This combination allowed us to create a dynamic and responsive web application with efficient global state management.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

https://www.figma.com/file/q5ht0e5fPrff1rBUVGO9aA/week-10?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=3MS79R4y132Ed0W6-1

To approach this project, we utilized React for building the interactive quiz application. We organized the questions and related data in an array of objects to maintain structured content. We leveraged the Zustand library to manage the global state efficiently, enabling seamless communication between components.

For planning, we divided the project into different sections, such as the welcome page, question rendering, feedback handling, and summary display. We created separate components for each section, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

Technologies used include React, Zustand for state management, and HTML/CSS for styling. We also imported Google Fonts to enhance typography and utilized media queries for responsive design.

If we had more time, we might consider adding features like a timer for each question, user authentication, and storing quiz results. Additionally, we could improve the user interface and add more interactive elements to enhance the overall user experience.
