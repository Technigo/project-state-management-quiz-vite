# State Management Quiz

Country Quiz - Week 10 state management project by Beckie Morton, Mikael Öling, Stenli Suryadinata & Olga Lepistö, Team Apple.

### The Problem

Our task was to build a quiz using state management. We have an international team so we decided on a quiz with questions regarding all of our countries and decided to use the Zustand method for state management. We had different time zones and schedules, so we shared the work between the team members.

At the time of handing in the project isn't completely ready: we still have a bug with our quiz summary component and the CSS needs a bit more defining.
