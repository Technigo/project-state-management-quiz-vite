# State Management Quiz

Create a quiz using Zustand to handle state, plus some css (mine was very basic)

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

This is not my strongest work but I worked hard regardless. I missed having a team as there were so many parts, but once I started breaking it down into smaller "team-pieces" it was easier. I had no inspiratoin for the css as I wanted to keep it simple, the background pic is the best thing of the whole page!
